# Game Challenge 1: Maze

You are presented with a 1000 by 40 maze (maze.txt) where each cell in the maze contains a number between 1 and 9.

Find the path through the maze between the top-left cell and the bottom right cell (only one solution exists per maze).

Output the sum of all of the numbers along the solution path.

## Example Maze
*Disclaimer*: The example maze in the challenge is much smaller than the challenge maze

## Output

```
201

```


## Flag

Compute the md5 checksum of the output file. Make sure the output file contains only the numeric answer and a newline.

For the example output above, the flag is:

```
9417bd061f365a7b4bd13783c878de86
```
