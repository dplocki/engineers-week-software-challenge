# Algorithms Challenge 1: Money Math

If you start with $1 and, with each move, you can either double your money or add another $1, what is the smallest number of moves you have to make to get to exactly $N?

Write a program to solve this for any possible amount **N** less than $1,000,000,000. The 'trials.txt' file contains the input data for the challenge flag.

## Example Input
The input is a file containing the amount to reach, **N**, for each trial on a different line.

```
2
15
16
50
200
```

The output file should contain the minumum number of moves to reach **N** for each trial on a different line. Note: The file should end with a newline character.

```
1 
6 
4 
7 
9 

```
The flag is the md5 checksum of the output file. For the example above, the flag is:
```
9f237b6e14f68b7a7c982192bb619324
```
