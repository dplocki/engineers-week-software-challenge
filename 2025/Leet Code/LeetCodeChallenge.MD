Athleet Challenge

The goal is to replace the blanks with the correct words to complete the algorithm or statement.
The md5 hash will be the comma separated list of all the blanks (no spaces). 
Numbers are written out in English, ex 10 should be ten.
All words are lower-case.

Sample Question
Reversing a ______ in place does not require extra _______. The ______ are reversed.
linkedlist,space,pointers

To prevent synonyms from failing the problem, we've provided the answers inside of this word pool which should be the only words used in the answer. 
The answers can be used multiple times from this pool.

Pool:
traverse, graph, cycle, depth, not, NOR
two, zero, one, NXOR, left, right, back, breadth
algorithm, value, XOR, edge, node, NAND,
AND, OR, tree, reverse

Question 1
The goal is to find a ______ in the list. 
To do so, you should have a fast and slow pointer. The fast pointer will jump ______ indicies for every ______ index the slow pointer jumps.
The pointers will eventually meet when the goal is reached.

Question 2
Perform inorder traversal of a binary tree. 

traverse(tree):
    if left:
        ______ left
    if right:
        ______ ______

Question 3

_____-First-Search is a traversal method that explores far down a graph before ____-tracking.

Question 4 

_____-First-Search is a traversal method that explores nodes level-by-level before ____-tracking.

Question 5

AND and ______ are logical operators that can be used to build any logical statement.
